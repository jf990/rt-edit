# Editor demo project (rt-edit)

A project to demo how to build a live editor.

This solution uses a project called [tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/docs). It is mostly open-source (has several pro plugins but the basic library is open-source) and it supports real-time collaboration. Otherwise this is experimental to see if we can make it work.

## Development

`npm install` then run `npm run dev` for a local build. In the console will be a message indicating where the local site is running:

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

Open a browser to that URL.
